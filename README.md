# Autonomous Vehicle Steering Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting steering angles in autonomous vehicle scenarios. The code is written in Python and uses Keras with TensorFlow backend for building and training the neural network model.

## Overview

The main file `final_code.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook generated in Google Colaboratory. It includes the code for loading and preprocessing data, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and training the model for predicting steering angles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- imgaug
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install imgaug opencv-python matplotlib numpy pandas
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rslim087a/track
cd track
```

### Dataset

The dataset consists of images and corresponding steering angles. The `driving_log.csv` file contains information about the paths to the center, left, and right camera images along with steering angles, throttle, reverse, and speed.

## Code Structure

- `load_img_steering`: Function to load image paths and steering angles.
- Data preprocessing, including balancing the dataset by removing samples with steering angles overrepresented.
- Data augmentation functions: `zoom`, `pan`, `img_random_brightness`, `img_random_flip`.
- Visualization of augmented images.
- Image preprocessing using `img_preprocess`.
- Data generator `batch_generator` for on-the-fly data augmentation during training.
- NVIDIA model architecture in `nvidia_model`.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Save the trained model to a file (`model.h5`).

## Model Summary

The NVIDIA model used for this project is summarized below:

Model: "sequential"
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
=================================================================
conv2d (Conv2D)              (None, 31, 98, 24)        1824
...
dense_3 (Dense)              (None, 1)                 11
=================================================================
Total params: 1,674,227
Trainable params: 1,674,227
Non-trainable params: 0
```

## Training

The model is trained using a data generator to efficiently handle a large dataset. Training parameters such as batch size, steps per epoch, and epochs can be adjusted according to your needs.

```bash
python final_code.ipynb
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with specific information if needed. Also, note that the model training command (`python final_code.ipynb`) assumes running the Jupyter Notebook from the command line. Adjust it accordingly if running in a different environment.
